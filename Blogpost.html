class="c4 doc-content"><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Top 3 places to travel outside of the US</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Malana Bates </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My family of six&mdash;my parents and three younger siblings&mdash;loves exploring new places. Every summer since I was 10 years old, we&#39;ve traveled outside the United States. We usually pick lesser-known spots because my dad prefers quieter places. Our first trip was to the Bahamas, and our most recent adventure was in Sardinia, Italy. Out of the ten places we&#39;ve been to, here are my top 3 favorites.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c3">#1 Bora Bora</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3 c5">Traveling to Bora bora </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Traveling to Bora Bora was an exciting journey for us. We left at 3 PM and drove to Washington Dulles International Airport. Our first layover was at Los Angeles International Airport. Our flight on United Airlines lasted about 6 hours. After a 2-hour layover in LAX, we flew to our second layover in Tahiti. We arrived at 11 PM and stayed at a hotel nearby. The next morning, we took a small plane from Tahiti to Bora Bora, which was an hour flight. The time difference between Virginia and Bora Bora was 5 hours, so we stayed awake most of the night because we were adjusting to the time change. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c3">Destination Highlights</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we reached Bora Bora, we got our luggage and rented a car&mdash;a surprise, as it turned out to be two Mokes, like golf carts. The island is tiny, taking only 45 minutes to drive around, so there were not many cars; instead, people used Mokes. We headed to our hotel, the InterContinental Le Moana Bora Bora, where we stayed in two overwater bungalows by the ocean.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c3">Exploring the island </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Exploring Bora Bora was incredible! The water was clear and calm. We could jump right into the water from our room, swim with stingrays, snorkel, and see sea life from our bungalow. Even though we usually explore every beach on the islands we visit, the best beach was at our hotel. Most days, we relaxed in the water, explored the island, and enjoyed water activities like kayaking, paddle boarding, jet skiing, and snorkeling offered by the resort.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Culinary Adventures</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">For food, options were limited on the small island apart from our hotel. We loved the delicious breakfast buffet at our hotel, especially the fresh fruit. Our favorite dinner spot was a place called Bloody Mary, where we went almost every night. Unfortunately, one night, a fight between my younger brothers caused a scene, and we couldn&#39;t go back there because of embarrassment. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c3">#2 Moorea </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c3">Traveling to Moorea </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">After our time in Bora Bora, we hopped on a quick 30-minute flight to Moorea. We stayed there for 5 nights and 6 days, renting more of those golf cart-like Mokes and settling into a lovely villa near the water. Moorea is famous for its black pearls, and where we stayed was pretty special. The lady who owned the house made jewelry with these unique pearls. We all got to pick something, and I chose a black pearl necklace. I thought it would look great layered with one I got from Hawaii a few years back.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c3">Destination Highlights</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moorea might be larger than Bora Bora, but it&#39;s still pretty quiet and not heavily populated. During our stay there, we had some amazing adventures.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;One day, we swam with sharks! We took a boat to a small island called Lagoonarium de Moorea, which sadly is closed now. But there are still lots of other ways to see sharks. At this place, the sharks gathered during feeding time. It was incredible! They even let us feed and touch them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another day, we went to Coco Beach on another island. The water there was unbelievable&mdash;so clear, like warm bathwater! We spent the whole day there, snorkeling, chilling out, eating at the restaurant, and trying paddle boarding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the next few days, we mostly hung out at our villa. They hooked us up with jet skis, kayaks, and paddle boards to use. We explored different beaches nearby, like Sunset Beach. It was a relaxed and fun time.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Culinary Adventures</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because the island was tiny, there weren&#39;t many restaurants around. We found some cute cafes, like Maz Cafe, where we loved having breakfast. Their coffee and pastries were just amazing!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For lunch and dinner, we checked out places like Rudy&#39;s, Snack Mahana, and Green Pearl. They were all yummy and served pretty similar food&mdash;lots of fish, burgers, and steaks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Goodbye French Polanysian</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, our trip had to end, and we flew back to Tahiti for our journey home. During our 5-hour layover, we explored a bit of the island before catching our flight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our adventure through these islands was packed with excitement and stunning views. It became my favorite and one of the most unforgettable trips our family has had.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c3">#3 Anguilla </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Traveling to Anguilla</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Departing from Anguilla, we flew from IAD to North Carolina for a layover. After a few hours, we boarded our flight to Anguilla. However, Anguilla being a small island, doesn&#39;t have an airport. Therefore, we flew to St. Maarten. From there, we hopped onto a small boat that ferried us over to the beautiful island of Anguilla. </span><span class="c0">Upon disembarking from the boat, we picked up our rental car, and here&#39;s the surprise&mdash;it had the steering wheel on the right side! While we&#39;ve visited places with different driving rules, seeing the wheel on that side was a first for me. After getting the car, we drove to our stunning villa on the island.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c3">Destination Highlights</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5 c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Anguilla is a tad larger than Bora Bora and Moorea, but we still managed to tour the entire island and explore every beach we could find. There are roughly 33 beaches on Anguilla, but when we visited right after a hurricane, there was still visible damage. Yet, despite that, the island remained exceptionally beautiful.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Among our favorite spots was a beach called Little Bay. Getting there was a bit adventurous&mdash;reaching the beach involved climbing down a steep rocky hill with a rope. While my dad and sister managed it easily, my mom and I felt a bit scared. Plus, my younger brothers were too little to handle it. Luckily, we found another option nearby. We rented small pedal boats and paddled our way to the beach, which was a safer and fun alternative.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">When we arrived, there was a massive rock where people were jumping off into the water. We headed over, climbed up the rock, and joined in the jumping fun. Another beach we loved was Shoal Bay. It boasted beautiful sandy shores, calm and crystal-clear waters, and fantastic opportunities for snorkeling.</span></p><p class="c7 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Culinary Adventures</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">When it comes to great food from my travels, Anguilla takes the prize! There were tons of fantastic restaurants all over the island, and the food was incredibly delicious. A couple of my top picks were Straw Hat and Gwen&#39;s Reggae Bar and Grill. At Gwen&#39;s, it&#39;s more like a barbecue place, and guess what? It&#39;s right on the beach! They have picnic tables in the sand, and the coolest part is the dog that hangs out there. The dog belongs to Bankie Banks, a famous musician in Anguilla who&#39;s played with big stars like Jimmy Buffet and Bob Dylan. He&#39;s often around, and we even got to snap a picture with him.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Straw Hat was probably my family&#39;s absolute favorite. We couldn&#39;t get enough of it! We went there for lunch and dinner multiple times because the food was just that good. Plus, it&#39;s also right by the beach, and let me tell you, the sunsets from there were out of this world. They were unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen before!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c3">Coming to an end </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9">Sadly every good trip has to come to an end, and we had to leave, we boated back to st maarten had a little bit of a layover and from there took a very small plane to puerto rico, ive never seen such a small airport before it was crazy, the airport was basically all outside. Finally from there had a layover and finally flew back to north carolina for out last flight home to IAD &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c3">&#8203;&#8203;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c3">Traveling </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Thinking back on these amazing adventures makes me incredibly happy and grateful. Every stop revealed its own riches, from the tropical refuge of Bora Bora to the tranquil landscapes of Moorea and the pristine beauty of Anguilla.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">With its pristine waters and overwater bungalows, Bora Bora transformed into a paradise where we enjoyed water sports and sunsets that will never be forgotten. Moorea, famous for its black pearls, provided experiences such as shark swimming and leisurely beach days. Despite the effects of the hurricane, Anguilla managed to conjure its charm with gorgeous beaches like Little Bay and Shoal Bay as well as delicious food. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Our travels were about more than just seeing the destinations on our list; they were about spending quality time together as a family, exploring other cultures, and making priceless memories. Every island offered a fresh chapter in our journey, leaving us feeling motivated and enriched. I hope to have the opportunity to travel to all of the stunning locations in the world, as there are so many of them. </span></p><p class="c7 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c12"></span></p></body></html>
